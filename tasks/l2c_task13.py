#Use a for loop and the knowledge you know about modulo to create a FizzBuzz program.
#In the program, the following happens:
#	Counting up from 1 to 100:
#		If the number is divisible by 3, print Fizz.
#		If the number is divisible by 5, print Buzz.
#		If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
#		Otherwise, just print the number.

#Reminder: You can look back at the previous tasks to see how to print, use a for loop and the modulo operator.

#Write your code below:
