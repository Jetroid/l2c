#Create a for loop that will print out the numbers from 1 to 10.
#Make the upper limit a variable so you can easily change it.

#Hint: You can use range() to generate numbers in the range you give.
# ie. range(1, 5) will produce numbers from 1 to 4.
# Remember that range is exclusive of the upper bound number so it will go up to but not including it.

#Write your code below: 

upperLimit = 11

for i in range(1, upperLimit):
    print(i)
