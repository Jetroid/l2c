#Can you finish the program below so that:
# the variable mystring is assigned to the value of "Python!"
# the variable pi is assigned to the value of 3.14
# the variable seven is assigned to the value of 7

#Reminder: A variable can be assigned to the value types such as strings, floats or integers using the = operator.
#Reminder: A string is defined by single quotes or double quotes and is essentially text.
#Reminder: A float is a decimal number. It can be defined with either a decimal point, eg 1.0, or with the float() function, eg float(1.234)
#Reminder: An integer is a whole number. eg 52

#Solution:
mystring = "Python!"
print(mystring)

pi = 3.14
# or
pi = float(3.14)
print(pi)
#Note: Your answer may print 3.1400000000000001 here. This is due to rounding issues. It is not a problem.

seven = 7
print(seven)
