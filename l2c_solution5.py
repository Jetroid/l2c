# Finish the program to print out the third element, followed by the multiplication of the second and fourth elements, then followed by the first element of the list mylist.
# Reminder: Lists in Python are zero-indexed. This means that the first element is at position zero.
# Reminder: You can access the element of a list as such: list[0] gets the first element from the list. 

#Solution:
mylist = ["pies.", 3, "I like to eat ", 11]

print(mylist[2])
print(mylist[1] * mylist[3])
print(mylist[0])
