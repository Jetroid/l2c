#Can you finish the program below so that:
# the variable mystring is assigned to the value of "Python" by string concatenation
# the variable two is assigned to the value of 2 by addition
# the variable fourteen is assigned to the value of 14 by multiplication
# the variable nine is assigned to the value of 9 by using exponents (powers).

#Reminder: String concatenation is when you join two strings together with the + operator
#Reminder: Addition uses the + operator too
#Reminder: Multiplication uses the * operator
#Reminder: Exponents (Raised to the power of) uses the ** operator. Eg: 2 ** 3 = 8

#Solution:
mystring = "Pyt" + "hon!"
print(mystring)

two = 1 + 1  
print(two) 

fourteen = 7 * 2 
print(fourteen)

nine = 3 ** 2 
print(nine)
